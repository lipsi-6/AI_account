In Sudoku, the strategy resembles a depth-first search approach, where the model appears to explore potential solutions and backtracks when it hits dead ends. Unlike Sudoku, which involves frequent backtracking, the ARC solution path follows a more consistent progression similar to hill-climbing optimization."
