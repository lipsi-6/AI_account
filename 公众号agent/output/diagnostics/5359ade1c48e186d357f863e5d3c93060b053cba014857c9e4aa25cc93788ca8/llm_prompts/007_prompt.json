Higher-level areas integrate information over longer timescales and form abstract representations, while lower-level areas handle more immediate, detailed sensory and motor processing [20, 22, 21]. Figure 2: **The necessity of depth for complex reasoning. Left:** On _Sudoku-Extreme Full_, which require extensive tree-search and backtracking, increasing a Transformer’s width yields no performance gain, while increasing depth is critical. **Right:** Standard architectures saturates, failing to benefit from increased depth. HRM overcomes this fundamental limitation, effectively using its computational depth to achieve near-perfect accuracy. * **Temporal Separation:** These hierarchical levels in the brain operate at distinct intrinsic timescales, reflected in neural rhythms (e. This separation allows for stable, high-level guidance of rapid, low-level computations [32, 33]. * **Recurrent Connectivity:** The brain features extensive"
