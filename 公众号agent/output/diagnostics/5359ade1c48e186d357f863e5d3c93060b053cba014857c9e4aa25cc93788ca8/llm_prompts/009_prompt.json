Let \\(M\\) denote the total number of segments executed before termination. A Q-head uses the final state of the H-module to predict the Q-values \\(\\hat{Q}^{m}=(\\hat{Q}^{m}_{\\text{halt}},\\hat{Q}^{m}_{\\text{continue}})\\) of the \"halt\" and \"continue\" actions: \\[\\hat{Q}^{m}=\\sigma(\\theta_{Q}^{\\top}z_{H}^{mNT})\\,,\\] where \\(\\sigma\\) denotes the sigmoid function applied element-wise. The halt or continue action is chosen using a randomized strategy as detailed next. Let \\(M_{\\max}\\) denote the maximum number of segments (a fixed hyperparameter) and \\(M_{\\min}\\) denote the minimum number of segments (a random variable). The value of \\(M_{\\min}\\) is determined stochastically: with probability \\(\\varepsilon\\), it is sampled uniformly from the set \\(\\{2,\\cdots,M_{\\max}\\}\\) (to encourage longer thinking), and with probability \\(1-\\varepsilon\\), it is set to 1. The halt action is selected under two conditions: when the segment count surpasses the maximum threshold \\(M_{\\max}\\), or when th"
