The initial version, ARC-AGI-1, presents challenges as input-output grid pairs that force AI systems to extract and generalize abstract rules from just a few examples. Each task provides a few input-output example pairs (usually 2-3) and a test input. An AI model has two attempts to produce the correct output grid. Although some believe that mastering ARC-AGI would signal true artificial general intelligence, its primary purpose is to expose the current roadblocks in AGI progress. In fact, both conventional deep learning methods and CoT techniques have faced significant challenges with ARC-AGI-1, primarily because it requires the ability to generalize to entirely new tasks [28]. Addressing the limitations identified in ARC-AGI-1, ARC-AGI-2 significantly expands the benchmark by providing a more comprehensive and carefully refined collection of tasks. These new tasks emphasize deeper compositional reasoning, multi-step logic, contextual rule application, and symbolic abstraction. Human calibration studies show these tasks are challenging "
