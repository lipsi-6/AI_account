With only 27M parameters and training on just 1000 examples, HRM effectively solves challenging reasoning problems such as ARC, Sudoku, and complex maze navigation-tasks that typically pose significant difficulties for contemporary LLM and chain-of-thought models. Although the brain relies heavily on hierarchical structures to enable most cognitive processes, these concepts have largely remained confined to academic literature rather than being translated into practical applications. The prevailing AI approach continues to favor non-hierarchical models. Our results challenge this established paradigm and suggest that the Hierarchical Reasoning Model represents a viable alternative to the currently dominant chain-of-thought reasoning methods, advancing toward a foundational framework capable of Turing-complete universal computation."
