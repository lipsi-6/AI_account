Addressing this question is important for enhancing model interpretability and developing a deeper understanding of the HRM solution space. In the Maze task, HRM appears to initially explore several potential paths simultaneously, subsequently eliminating blocked or inefficient routes, then constructing a preliminary solution outline followed by multiple refinement iterations. HRM uses a different approach for ARC tasks, making incremental adjustments to the board and iteratively improving it until reaching a solution. Importantly, the model shows that it can adapt to different reasoning approaches, likely choosing an effective strategy for each particular task. Further research is needed to gain more comprehensive insights into these solution strategies."
