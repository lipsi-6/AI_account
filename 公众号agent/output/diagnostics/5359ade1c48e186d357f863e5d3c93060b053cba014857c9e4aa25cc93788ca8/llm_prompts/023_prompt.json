Higher-order cortical areas, responsible for complex reasoning and decision-making, must handle a wide variety of tasks, demanding more flexible and context-dependent processing [77]. In dynamical systems, this flexibility is often realized through higher-dimensional state-space trajectories, which allow for a richer repertoire of potential computations [78]. This principle gives rise to an observable _dimensionality hierarchy_, where a region's position in the processing hierarchy correlates with its _effective dimensionality_. To quantify this phenomenon, we can examine the Figure 7: **Visualization of intermediate predictions by HRM on benchmark tasks. ****Top:**_MazeHard_—blue cells indicate the predicted path. **Middle:**_Sudoku-Extreme_—bold cells represent initial givens; red highlights cells violating Sudoku constraints; Figure 8: **Hierarchical Dimensionality Organization in the HRM and Mouse Cortex. ****(a,b)** are adapted from Pos"
