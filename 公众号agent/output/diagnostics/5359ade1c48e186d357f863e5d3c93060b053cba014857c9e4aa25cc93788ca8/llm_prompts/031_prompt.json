This design enables an architecture to perform a range of cognitive tasks, from memory recall to simple reasoning puzzles. However, its reasoning relies on hand-designed algorithms, which may limit its ability to learn new tasks. These models often require hand-made rules to be set up for solving a specific reasoning task. In essence, while prior models are restricted to simple reasoning problems, HRM is designed to solve complex tasks that are hard for even advanced LLMs, without pre-training or task-specific manual design. Since HRM focuses on reasoning, full attention is applied for simplicity. Incorporating hierarchical memory into HRM could be a promising future direction."
