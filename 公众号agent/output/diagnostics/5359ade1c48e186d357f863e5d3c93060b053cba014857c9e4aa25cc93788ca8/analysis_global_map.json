  "abstract_summary": "The paper introduces the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM), a novel recurrent architecture inspired by hierarchical processing in the human brain, designed to enhance computational depth and efficiency in AI reasoning tasks. HRM employs two interdependent recurrent modules for abstract planning and detailed computations, achieving superior performance on complex tasks with minimal training data and without pre-training or Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques.",

  ],
  "methodology_overview": "HRM features two coupled recurrent modules: a high-level (H) module for slow, abstract planning and a low-level (L) module for rapid, detailed computations. The model avoids rapid convergence through hierarchical convergence, where the H-module advances only after the L-module reaches equilibrium. Training employs a one-step gradient approximation, eliminating the need for Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT).",
